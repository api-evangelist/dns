  name: Domain name resolution using a distributed DNS network
  summary: ""
  abstract: A distributed DNS network includes a central origin server that actually
    controls the zone, and edge DNS cache servers configured to cache the DNS content
    of the origin server. The edge DNS cache servers are published as the authoritative
    servers for customer domains instead of the origin server. When a request for
    a DNS record results in a cache miss, the edge DNS cache servers get the information
    from the origin server and cache it for use in response to future requests. Multiple
    edge DNS cache servers can be deployed at multiple locations. Since an unlimited
    number of edge DNS cache servers can be deployed, the system is highly scalable.
    The disclosed techniques protect against DoS attacks, as DNS requests are not
    made to the origin server directly.

  name: Embedding overlay virtual network addresses in underlying substrate network
    addresses
  summary: ""
  abstract: Techniques are described for managing communications between multiple
    computing nodes, such as computing nodes that are separated by one or more physical
    networks. In some situations, the techniques may be used to provide a virtual
    network between multiple computing nodes that are separated by one or more intermediate
    physical networks, such as from the edge of the one or more intermediate physical
    networks by modifying communications that enter and/or leave the intermediate
    physical networks. In some situations, the computing nodes may include virtual
    machine nodes hosted on one or more physical computing machines or systems, such
    as by or on behalf of one or more users (e.g., users of a program execution service).
    The managing of the communications may include using substrate network addresses
    that are configured to embed virtual network addresses for a virtual network that
    is overlaid on the underlying physical substrate network.

  name: Cross-domain communication in domain-restricted communication environments
  summary: ""
  abstract: A messaging frame can be used to allow different domains to communicate
    in an electronic environment that are otherwise prevented from directly communicating.
    A messaging frame or other communication element can be configured to receive
    messages or communications from any frame, object, or element in the same domain
    as the messaging frame. The messaging frame then can switch to a target domain
    in order to provide the message or communication to a frame, object, or element
    in the target domain. The messaging frame can include an interface definition
    that allows only approved messages to be passed between domains, such that the
    risk of malicious attack is minimized.

  summary: ""
  abstract: "Techniques are described for managing communications for a managed virtual
    computer network overlaid on a distinct substrate computer network, including
    for communications involving computing nodes of the managed virtual computer network
    that use an alternative addressing scheme to direct network packets and other

  name: Methods and apparatus for remapping public network addresses on a network
    to an external network via an intermediate network
  summary: ""
  abstract: Methods and apparatus for remapping IP addresses of a network to endpoints
    within a different network. A provider network may allocate IP addresses and resources
    to a customer. The provider network may allow the customer to map an IP address
    to remap an IP address to an endpoint on the customer's network. When a packet
    is received from a client addressed to the IP address, the provider network may
    determine that the IP address has been remapped to the endpoint. The provider
    network may translate the source and destination addresses of the packet and modify
    the source address of the packet to indicate the endpoint as the destination,
    and send the modified packet to the endpoint via the Internetan intermediate network.
    Response traffic may be routed to the client through the provider network, or
    may be directly routed to the client by the customer network.

  name: Distributed network address translation
  summary: ""
  abstract: Systems and methods are disclosed that facilitate the management of network
    address information utilized by hosted computing devices. Each host computing
    device includes a local network and port address management component that is
    configured with port address translation information for the specific host computing
    device. Additionally, one or more edge computing devices also include a local
    network and port address management component that is configured with network
    and port address translation information. The network and port address translation
    information facilitates the correlation of internal network address information
    associated with a virtual machine instance with a tuple of an externally accessible
    network address and port address information. The local network and port address
    translation management components utilize the network and port address translation
    information to translate communication requests to and from the virtual machine
    instances without requiring a centralized network and port address translation
    component.

    computing nodes of a managed computer network to dynamically signal particular
    types of uses of one or more indicated target network addresses and/or to dynamically
    signal use of particular external public network addresses based on such routing
    information.
