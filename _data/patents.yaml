  name: Domain name resolution using a distributed DNS network
  summary: ""
  abstract: A distributed DNS network includes a central origin server that actually
    controls the zone, and edge DNS cache servers configured to cache the DNS content
    of the origin server. The edge DNS cache servers are published as the authoritative
    servers for customer domains instead of the origin server. When a request for
    a DNS record results in a cache miss, the edge DNS cache servers get the information
    from the origin server and cache it for use in response to future requests. Multiple
    edge DNS cache servers can be deployed at multiple locations. Since an unlimited
    number of edge DNS cache servers can be deployed, the system is highly scalable.
    The disclosed techniques protect against DoS attacks, as DNS requests are not
    made to the origin server directly.
