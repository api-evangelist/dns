  name: Domain name resolution using a distributed DNS network
  summary: ""
  abstract: A distributed DNS network includes a central origin server that actually
    controls the zone, and edge DNS cache servers configured to cache the DNS content
    of the origin server. The edge DNS cache servers are published as the authoritative
    servers for customer domains instead of the origin server. When a request for
    a DNS record results in a cache miss, the edge DNS cache servers get the information
    from the origin server and cache it for use in response to future requests. Multiple
    edge DNS cache servers can be deployed at multiple locations. Since an unlimited
    number of edge DNS cache servers can be deployed, the system is highly scalable.
    The disclosed techniques protect against DoS attacks, as DNS requests are not
    made to the origin server directly.

  name: Embedding overlay virtual network addresses in underlying substrate network
    addresses
  summary: ""
  abstract: Techniques are described for managing communications between multiple
    computing nodes, such as computing nodes that are separated by one or more physical
    networks. In some situations, the techniques may be used to provide a virtual
    network between multiple computing nodes that are separated by one or more intermediate
    physical networks, such as from the edge of the one or more intermediate physical
    networks by modifying communications that enter and/or leave the intermediate
    physical networks. In some situations, the computing nodes may include virtual
    machine nodes hosted on one or more physical computing machines or systems, such
    as by or on behalf of one or more users (e.g., users of a program execution service).
    The managing of the communications may include using substrate network addresses
    that are configured to embed virtual network addresses for a virtual network that
    is overlaid on the underlying physical substrate network.

  summary: ""
  abstract: Methods and apparatus for remapping IP addresses of a network to endpoints
    within a different network. A provider network may allocate IP addresses and resources
    to a customer. The provider network may allow the customer to map an IP address
    to remap an IP address to an endpoint on the customer's network. When a packet
    is received from a client addressed to the IP address, the provider network may
    determine that the IP address has been remapped to the endpoint. The provider
    network may translate the source and destination addresses of the packet and modify
    the source address of the packet to indicate the endpoint as the destination,
    and send the modified packet to the endpoint via the Internetan intermediate network.
    Response traffic may be routed to the client through the provider network, or
    may be directly routed to the client by the customer network.

  summary: ""
  abstract: An Internet-based proxy service server accesses a set of visitor characteristics
    for multiple visitors to a set of one or more domains operated by a customer.
    The set of visitor characteristics are reported from a set of one or more proxy
    servers that are situated between client devices and a set of one or more origin
    servers for the set of domains. The service server causes the set of visitor characteristics
    to be displayed through a threat reporting interface that allows the customer
    to report visitors as posing an Internet security threat. The service server receives
    input from the customer through the threat reporting interface that at least one
    of the visitors poses an Internet security threat, and records that visitor as
    an Internet security threat in one or more threat databases that are used by the
    proxy servers when determining whether to allow visitors to access network resources
    hosted at a set of one or more origin servers.

  abstract: Systems and methods are disclosed that facilitate the management of network
    address information utilized by hosted computing devices. Each host computing
    device includes a local network and port address management component that is
    configured with port address translation information for the specific host computing
    device. Additionally, one or more edge computing devices also include a local
    network and port address management component that is configured with network
    and port address translation information. The network and port address translation
    information facilitates the correlation of internal network address information
    associated with a virtual machine instance with a tuple of an externally accessible
    network address and port address information. The local network and port address
    translation management components utilize the network and port address translation
    information to translate communication requests to and from the virtual machine
    instances without requiring a centralized network and port address translation
    component.
