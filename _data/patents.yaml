  name: Method and apparatus for improving received signal quality in an impulse radio
    system
  summary: ""
  abstract: An impulse radio system includes an impulse transmitter that transmits
    a pulse train comprising a number of pulses that are positioned in time for conveying
    an information signal. An impulse receiver receives the pulse train in accordance
    with specified arrival times of each pulse and measures interference samples at
    interference sample times that do not coincide with the pulse arrival times. The
    interference sample times are varied and the received pulse train signal is modified
    until a received signal quality criterion is satisfied. The interference sample
    times may be specified by a code that may also specify pulse arrival times.

  name: M-Ary phase shift keying (PSK) bit-boundary turbo coded system
  summary: ""
  abstract: A turbo coded communication system includes a gray scale mapper in a transmitter
    for generating a symbol constellation of modulated signals points that can be
    separated by boundary lines in the constellation space into bitwise groups of
    zero bits and one bits where the shortest distance from a boundary line to received
    value in the constellation space indicates the bitwise soft metrics that is computed
    using a set of bitwise soft metric equations are a function of a minimum angle
    using closed form algebraic equations in turbo decoding receiver. In the case
    of phase shift keying (PSK) modulation, the bit boundary lines are predetermined
    by a minimum angle in the constellation space for a specified M-ary modulation,
    so that, the soft metric equations are only a function of the received signal
    value for providing efficient computation of the bitwise soft metric.

  name: Modular optical detector system
  summary: ""
  abstract: A modular optical detector system. The detector system is designed to
    detect the presence of molecules or molecular species by inducing fluorescence
    with exciting radiation and detecting the emitted fluorescence. Because the system
    is capable of accurately detecting and measuring picomolar concentrations it is
    ideally suited for use with microchemical analysis systems generally and capillary
    chromatographic systems in particular. By employing a modular design, the detector
    system provides both the ability to replace various elements of the detector system
    without requiring extensive realignment or recalibration of the components as
    well as minimal user interaction with the system. In addition, the modular concept
    provides for the use and addition of a wide variety of components, including optical
    elements (lenses and filters), light sources, and detection means, to fit particular
    needs.

  name: Domain name resolution using a distributed DNS network
  summary: ""
  abstract: A distributed DNS network includes a central origin server that actually
    controls the zone, and edge DNS cache servers configured to cache the DNS content
    of the origin server. The edge DNS cache servers are published as the authoritative
    servers for customer domains instead of the origin server. When a request for
    a DNS record results in a cache miss, the edge DNS cache servers get the information
    from the origin server and cache it for use in response to future requests. Multiple
    edge DNS cache servers can be deployed at multiple locations. Since an unlimited
    number of edge DNS cache servers can be deployed, the system is highly scalable.
    The disclosed techniques protect against DoS attacks, as DNS requests are not
    made to the origin server directly.

  name: Fast acquisition of a pilot signal in a wireless communication device
  summary: ""
  abstract: "In a remote unit of a wireless communication system, the speed of acquisition,
    or reacquisition, of a pilot signal by a search engine is increased. PN space
    is divided into segments and a coarse search of each segment is performed using
    a set of \u201Cfast\u201D search parameters. A set of peak signal strengths, along
    with their corresponding PN offsets, is saved for each segment of PN space. Following
    the search of all segments of PN space, the peak signal strengths which were saved
    during the coarse acquisition are evaluated. Coarse acquisition search results
    are used by the remote unit to determine fine search window parameters for subsequent

  name: Backlight dimming and LCD amplitude boost
  summary: ""
  abstract: Embodiments of the present invention generally provide methods and apparatus
    for reducing power consumption of backlit displays are described. Power consumption
    is reduced by dimming backlighting by a first scale factor and boosting pixel
    values by a second scale factor to compensate for the dimming. The scale factors
    may be constant values. Alternately, one or both of the scale factors may be determined
    based on pixel values for one or more frames to be displayed and/or one or more
    frames that have been displayed. For example, scale factors may be calculated
    based on an average linear amplitude of one or more frames of pixel values or
    from a maximum pixel value of one or more frames of pixel values. A graphical
    processing system is described including an integrated circuit capable of transforming
    a pixel value from a gamma-compensated space to a linear space.

  name: Domain name resolution using a distributed DNS network
  summary: ""
  abstract: A distributed DNS network includes a central origin server that actually
    controls the zone, and edge DNS cache servers configured to cache the DNS content
    of the origin server. The edge DNS cache servers are published as the authoritative
    servers for customer domains instead of the origin server. When a request for
    a DNS record results in a cache miss, the edge DNS cache servers get the information
    from the origin server and cache it for use in response to future requests. Multiple
    edge DNS cache servers can be deployed at multiple locations. Since an unlimited
    number of edge DNS cache servers can be deployed, the system is highly scalable.
    The disclosed techniques protect against DoS attacks, as DNS requests are not
    made to the origin server directly.

    can be selected from among various alternatives by reference to resource costs,
    resource constraints, other stimulus information (e.g., audio), task substitutability,
    etc. The phone can apply more or less resources to an image processing task depending
    on how successfully the task is proceeding, or based on the user's apparent interest
    in the task. In some arrangements, data may be referred to the cloud for analysis,
    or for gleaning. Cognition, and identification of appropriate device response(s),

  name: Managing hardware reboot and reset in shared environments
  summary: ""
  abstract: In an environment such as a cloud computing environment where various
    guests can be provisioned on a host machine or other hardware device, it can be
    desirable to prevent those users from rebooting or otherwise restarting the machine
    or other resources using unauthorized information or images that can be obtained
    from across the network. A cloud manager can cause one or more network switches
    or other routing or communication processing components to deny communication
    access between user-accessible ports on a machine or device and the provisioning
    systems, or other specific network resources, such that the user cannot cause
    the host machine to pull information from those resources upon a restart or reboot
    of the machine. Further, various actions can be taken upon a reboot or attempted
    reboot, such as to isolate the host machine or even power off the specific machine.

  abstract: Computer-readable media, computer systems, and computing methods are provided
    for implicitly discovering applications that have a corresponding location. Initially,
    an application manifest is constructed that maintains a mapping between apps and
    their respective geographic boundaries. In operation, upon detecting a location
    signal being transmitted from a mobile device, the location signal is employed
    to identify a set of valid applications. Generally, the location signal represents
    location-based information entered to or received from the mobile device. Identifying
    the set of valid applications involves comparing the location signal against the
    application manifest and, based on the comparison, designating those apps that
    are mapped to geographic boundaries that meet the location signal as the set of
    valid applications. Upon identifying the set of valid applications, a selection
    of apps included within the set of valid applications is sent to the mobile device

  summary: ""
  abstract: A domain name is received from a customer. DNS is queried for multiple
    possible subdomains of the domain. For each subdomain that resolves, information
    about that subdomain's corresponding resource record is stored in a zone file
    that also includes a resource record for the domain name. The zone file is presented
    to the customer. A designation from the customer of which of the resource records
    are to point to an IP address of a proxy server is received. The resource records
    are modified according to the input of the customer and the zone file is propagated
    including the modified resource records.

  name: Internet-based proxy service to limit internet visitor connection speed
  summary: ""
  abstract: A proxy server for limiting Internet connection speed of visitors that
    pose a threat. The proxy server receives from a client device a request to perform
    an action on an identified resource that is hosted at an origin server for a domain.
    The proxy server receives the request as a result of a DNS request for the domain
    resolving to the proxy server. The origin server is one of multiple origin servers
    that belong to different domains that resolve to the proxy server and are owned
    by different entities. The proxy server analyzes the request to determine whether
    a visitor belonging to the request poses a threat. If the proxy server determines
    that the visitor poses a threat, the proxy server reduces the speed at which the
    proxy server processes the request while keeping a connection to the client device
    open.
