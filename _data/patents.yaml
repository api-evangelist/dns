  name: Application programming interface and generalized network address translator
    for translation of transport-layer sessions
  summary: ""
  abstract: An application programming interface for translation of transport-layer
    sessions is presented. The system includes kernel-mode support for application-controlled
    network address translation and user-mode implementation of the redirect API routines.
    An application process may request that a network gateway modify the source and/or
    destination of a given network session in a manner transparent to the original
    source host and/or the replacement destination host. With the generalized NAT
    (gNAT) of the instant invention and its associated API, both the source and the
    destination addresses of message packets may be changed. The address changes are
    mapped in the gNAT, and may result in apparent sessions between different clients
    and servers. Depending on the protocol in use (e.g. TCP or UDP), the address translation
    may be made dynamically by the gNAT, under the command of the application, and
    take place at the kernel level.

  name: Web address converter for dynamic web pages
  summary: ""
  abstract: Herein is described an implementation of a Web address converter, which
    helps dynamic Web sites get the attention of spiders of Internet search engines.
    With the Web address converter, requests from Web browsers using static addresses
    access corresponding dynamic Web pages and requests from search engines generate
    an instance of a Web page having links with static addresses pointing to corresponding
    dynamic Web pages. The Web address converter performs either or both Dynamic-to-Static
    (D-to-S) address conversion and Static-to-Dynamic (S-to-D) address conversion.
    D-to-S address conversion is done when generating a spider-friendly main page
    for a spider of a search engine to crawl. S-to-D address conversion is used when
    a browser uses a static address to access a corresponding dynamic Web page. The
    static address that the browser uses was originally created when the spider-friendly
    main page was generated.

  name: Method and system for a second level address translation in a virtual machine
    environment
  summary: ""
  abstract: A method of performing a translation from a guest virtual address to a
    host physical address in a virtual machine environment includes receiving a guest
    virtual address from a host computer executing a guest virtual machine program
    and using the hardware oriented method of the host CPU to determine the guest
    physical address. A second level address translation to a host physical address
    is then performed. In one embodiment, a multiple tier tree is traversed which
    translates the guest physical address into a host physical address. In another
    embodiment, the second level of address translation is performed by employing
    a hash function of the guest physical address and a reference to a hash table.
    One aspect of the invention is the incorporation of access overrides associated
    with the host physical address which can control the access permissions of the
    host memory.

  name: Method and system for caching address translations from multiple address spaces
    in virtual machines
  summary: ""
  abstract: A method of virtualizing memory through shadow page tables that cache
    translations from multiple guest address spaces in a virtual machine includes
    a software version of a hardware tagged translation look-aside buffer. Edits to
    guest page tables are detected by intercepting the creation of guest-writable
    mappings to guest page tables with translations cached in shadow page tables.
    The affected cached translations are marked as stale and purged upon an address
    space switch or an indiscriminate flush of translations by the guest. Thereby,
    non-stale translations remain cached but stale translations are discarded. The
    method includes tracking the guest-writable mappings to guest page tables, deferring
    discovery of such mappings to a guest page table for the first time until a purge
    of all cached translations when the number of untracked guest page tables exceeds
    a threshold, and sharing shadow page tables between shadow address spaces and
    between virtual processors.

  name: Method and system for a guest physical address virtualization in a virtual
    machine environment
  summary: ""
  abstract: A method of sharing pages between virtual machines in a multiple virtual
    machine environment includes initially allocating a temporary guest physical address
    range of a first virtual machine for sharing pages with a second virtual machine.
    The temporary range is within a guest physical address space of the first virtual
    machine. An access request, such as with a DMA request, from a second virtual
    machine for pages available to the first virtual machine is received. A reference
    count of pending accesses to the pages is incremented to indicate a pending access
    and the ages are mapped into the temporary guest physical address range. The pages
    are accessed and the reference count is decremented. The mapping in the temporary
    guest physical address range is then removed if the reference count is zero.

  name: Domain name resolution using a distributed DNS network
  summary: ""
  abstract: A distributed DNS network includes a central origin server that actually
    controls the zone, and edge DNS cache servers configured to cache the DNS content
    of the origin server. The edge DNS cache servers are published as the authoritative
    servers for customer domains instead of the origin server. When a request for
    a DNS record results in a cache miss, the edge DNS cache servers get the information
    from the origin server and cache it for use in response to future requests. Multiple
    edge DNS cache servers can be deployed at multiple locations. Since an unlimited
    number of edge DNS cache servers can be deployed, the system is highly scalable.
    The disclosed techniques protect against DoS attacks, as DNS requests are not

    servers that are situated between client devices and a set of one or more origin
    servers for the set of domains. The service server causes the set of visitor characteristics
    to be displayed through a threat reporting interface that allows the customer
    to report visitors as posing an Internet security threat. The service server receives
    input from the customer through the threat reporting interface that at least one
    of the visitors poses an Internet security threat, and records that visitor as
    an Internet security threat in one or more threat databases that are used by the
    proxy servers when determining whether to allow visitors to access network resources
    hosted at a set of one or more origin servers.

  summary: ""
  abstract: Computer systems, methods, and computer readable media for facilitating
    a secure transaction are provided in which a client application is executed on
    a client computer. The client application initiates a request to a first domain
    comprising (i) a credential for the client application, (ii) a transaction identifier
    that uniquely identifies the request, and (iii) optionally, an identification
    of a user of the client application. Responsive to this request, the client receives
    a validated transaction module from the first domain. The client application loads
    the validated transaction module into a separate domain security sandbox that
    is segregated from memory space in which the client application is run. The validated
    transaction module conducts a validated transaction between the second domain
    and the validated transaction module. Separately, through the client application,
    a determination is made as to whether the transaction is complete by querying
    the first domain.
